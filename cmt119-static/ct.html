        <h2>What is Computational Thinking?</h2>
        <p>Computational Thinking (CT) is the step that occurs prior to programming. It’s the process defined as “taking an approach to solving problems, designing systems and understanding human behavior that draws on concepts fundamental to computing” (Wing 2006). CT combines skills in various disciplines—mathematics and problem-solving, engineering and designing and evaluating real-world systems, and sciences and understanding the mind and human behavior..</p>
        <br>
        <p>CT is said to be everywhere and influencing other disciplines—both sciences and humanities. It is still relatively new as computers were only introduced to humans recently and the field of computing is constantly changing, thus it is in its simple stage. This leaves room for computational thinking to evolve into something deeper that can deal with more complex concepts in the future.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are four key components of Computational Thinking:</p>
        <br>
            <p><b>Decomposition:</b> Breaking down complex problems into simpler, more manageable parts</p>
            <p><b>Pattern Recognition:</b> Identifying similarities among and within problems</p>
            <p><b>Abstraction:</b> Focusing on important information and ignoring anything irrelevant</p>
            <p><b>Algorithms:</b> Designing a step-by-step process to solve a problem</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here’s an example of CT being applied to my past work as a multimedia journalist and deciding on a story to cover.</p>
        <br>
        <p>First, I have to ask myself a few questions. What do people want to know? What is important? What is happening currently? How does this affect the community? Then, I can do research on past articles covering similar story topics. If I’m writing about the local cat shelter, I can browse a database to find what has already been written about it. Subsequently, I ignore any information that doesn’t support my story. After an interview, I will look through my transcript and highlight important quotes that I should include in my article while deleting off-topic comments. Finally, I work on writing my story. This includes building a strong lede, following the upside-down triangle format, referencing the AP style guides, and sending it to my editor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Making a jump from journalism to computing is a difficult task and computational thinking will help me adopt the computing mindset. I plan on pursuing a career in frontend development and/or user interface/user experience design. This will require me to work in teams to solve problems and it is essential to apply computational thinking to do so effectively. With UI/UX, I will be collecting data from users and analyzing it to design or fix something that would optimize their experience using a website or application. I hope to combine my knowledge from my humanities background with CT in order to become a better programmer.</p>
