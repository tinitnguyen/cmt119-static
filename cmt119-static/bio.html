        <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
        <div class="column">
            <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or better known as Ada Lovelace (born December 10th, 1815 in London, England—died November 27th, 1852 in Marylebone, London) was a British mathematician renowned for being the first computer programmer, having developed a program for the father of computer Charles Babbage’s digital computer prototype.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lovelace’s mother, Anne Isabella Noel Byron, studied mathematics, an uncommon field of study for a woman during that time period, and Lord Byron insisted Lovelace follow her path. Lovelace was privately educated with one of her tutors being Augustus De Morgan, who was the first mathematics professor at the University of London. Lovelace displayed advanced skills in numbers and language from an early age.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 1833, Lovelace was introduced to mathematician and inventor Babbage and was amazed by the difference engine Babbage created for mathematical calculations. He had another engine in the works, the analytical engine, which was meant for more complex calculations. Babbage took on a mentoring role for Lovelace.</p>
            <br>
            <p>She translated an article written about Babbage’s analytical engine by Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea. She not only translated the piece but added her own extensive commentary and notes on the invention. Her work included a theorized method for the device to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping which is used by modern computers amongst other ideas for solving mathematical problems. She speculated that the machine could process letters and symbols beyond numbers, which would pivot from calculation to computation. Her translated article ended up being three times longer than the original and was published in an English science journal in 1843 under the initials “A.A.L” for Augusta Ada Lovelace. This would lead her to being considered the prophet of the computer age.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Unfortunately, her work did not receive much recognition during her lifetime. Her later attempts at developing a mathematical scheme failed and landed her in financial trouble. She passed away on November 27, 1852 from uterine cancer.</p>
