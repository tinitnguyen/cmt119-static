        <h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
        <p>The CMT119 module on Computational Thinking introduced me to the basics of computing. This includes the core topic of Computational Thinking, web development (HTML and CSS), responsive web design, and number systems and data representation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am familiar with HTML and CSS due to my journalism background and having run blogs in the past. I also started an online class on responsive web design over the summer, so this module helped refresh and deepen my knowledge of HTML and CSS. This was my favorite section of this module and I enjoy the hands-on activities that were provided, such as replicating the homepage of Cardiff University’s website. I am keen to transfer that excitement to my other modules, such as Fundamentals of Programming. Moving from HTML and CSS onto programming languages like Python and Javascript is a bit of a struggle, but I believe applying the process of Computational Thinking has helped me in establishing a better grasp of programming.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Computational Thinking itself has been an interesting section to me seeing as it can be found virtually anywhere. It goes beyond STEM and has influences on the humanities as well as everyday life. This is a new way of thinking that I have not been exposed to prior. After learning about Computational Thinking, I found that I have applied it to my background as a journalist, as well as my everyday life without knowing. An example that we were represented with was how to make a cup of tea. I make tea daily and it’s autopilot for me now, but I realize now how easy it is to apply computational thinking to basically anything.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The number systems were a bit overwhelming for me as I have not dealt with numbers in sometime. This showed me the importance of mathematics in relation to computing, which is a bit of a worry for me as I am not the strongest at maths. I will have to spend more time on the mathematical concepts of this course to fully understand them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am looking forward to future modules, especially the optional Human Centric Computing module. This module aligns with the branch of computing I want to pursue a career in—human computer interaction and user experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>CMT119 was a friendly approach to learning computing having come from a non-computing background, and has allowed me to identify my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to computing and even studying in general.</p>
